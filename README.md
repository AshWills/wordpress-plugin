### FAQ

**Where can I find the plugin settings?**
This plugin has just a single settings field, which can be found by going to WP Admin > Settings > Fathom Analytics.

**Where do I find my SiteID?**
Your SiteID is the unique code in your tracking snippet. Go to your Dashboard, click Settings, then Sites. The SiteID is the second column, copy and paste it from there into the field on the settings page in WordPress.

**What’s the Fathom share password?**
In order to use Fathom Analytics for WordPress your dashboard must be set to “Public” or “Viewable to anyone with the share password”. If your dashboard is public, skip the Fathom Share Password field. If your dashboard is set to have a share password, enter that password in this field.

**What’s the Fathom Fathom URL?**
Leave this set to “cdn.usefathom.com” unless you are using Fathom Lite (the OS version), and in that case, enter the tracker URL you are using.
