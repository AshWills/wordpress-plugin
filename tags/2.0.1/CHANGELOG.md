Changelog
==========

#### 2.0.1 - April 15, 2020

What a time to be alive. We have officially added custom domains to Fathom to help with those pesky ad-blockers. And we moved the snippet to the footer (where it escaped from).

#### 2.0.0 - November 15, 2019

Well first of all, we are sorry for the long delay in updating this plugin! We've been busy at work on Fathom V2 all year. In this major update of the wordpress plugin, we've ensured backward compatability but have modified the guidelines to include some of the new changes we have made. Firstly, the concept of a "Dashboard URL" doesn't exist within V2, and you simply use the CDN URL! Nice and easy. But we have left the Dashboard URL in place for our V1 users who self-host. We've also added the ability for V2 users to embed their dashboard & create a new tab in the admin menu.

#### 1.0.1 - October 10, 2018

Added support for tracking multiple sites in a single Fathom dashboard (requires Fathom v1.0.1).


#### 1.0.0 - September 10, 2018

Plugin release.
